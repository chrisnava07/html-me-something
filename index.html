                    <p>I was born on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Air_Force_Base">Travis AFB, California</a>. It's a
                    fairly large Air Force Base in central California. Most of my family is or was in the military so I've spent most
                    of my life surrounded by it. We lived there On and off until I was about 11. It was hot, I was not a fan. Mexican food was hella
                    dope, though.</p>

                    <p>After my parents divorced (#sad #notreallythatbigadeal #itwas22yearsagowhocares) my mother married a

                    He was transferred from San Diego to the tourist-heavy Virginia Beach, Virginia I wasn't the biggest fan of the beach and because
                    both of them came into the marriage with kids, there were a ton of us running aroud.The schools were good and if you like seafood,
                    it's the dankest of dank in that area.</p>

                    <p>When my older brother was going into high school, our parents decided we should stop changing schools every year and complete all of high school
                    in one place. That was a good decision because changing schools every year blew. 0/10, would not recommend. We moved to historic(...?)
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Carbon,_Illinois"> Glen Carbon, Illinois</a>. Everyone seems to hate wherever they went
                    to high school/grew up, but I love the area. Not too fast paced like you city-folk seem to like. lots of camo in that area. I wasn't prepared
                    for that since, ya know, it's a fairly large and not-very-country-feeling town.</p>
